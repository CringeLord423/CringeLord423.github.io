			This is a stock trading simulation I built in Flask. It can be found on <a href="https://github.com/CringeLord423/cs50Web/tree/master/finance">Github</a>.
			The project enables the user to purchase and sell stocks using real-time prices as well as view all transactions they have made.
			It was made as part of Harvard's CS50 course's web design track.
